What are the points that I want to make in this email about lumisight?

Are we going to cancel?
What did we pay for?
Are we holding it in standby?
Oh wait, we're still using it for checkins with the front desk...
Do we still want to do that?
probably. Gah! So do I not send this email?
I mean, Eric asked me to send it, so I probably should send something...

Why am I freaking out so hard over this? it isn't a big deal. ds;alfkjsd;flkjsdaf;lkjadsoiweurpiofudhov

I'm freaking out because I need more... Elan? Confidence in myself? soemthing, surely.



I don't know what else to say in this email, so I'm just going to leave it here for later.
