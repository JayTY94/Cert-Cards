DNS
An NS record delegates a subdomain to a set of name servers. Whenever you delegate a domain to DNSimple, the TLD authorities place NS records for your domain in the TLD name servers pointing to us.

DNS
DNS zone transfers using the AXFR protocol are the simplest mechanism to replicate DNS records across DNS servers. To avoid the need to edit information on multiple DNS servers, you can edit information on one server and use AXFR to copy information to other servers

A channel is a logging method, a way to funnel log messages somewhere, usually the syslog daemon or a file. The general syntax for a chanel is quite complex.

DNS
The DNS Start of Authority (SOA) record stores important information about a domain or zone such as the email address of the administrator, when the domain was last updated, and how long the server should wait between refreshes.

DNS
A PTR (or Pointer) record is a security tool. Essentially, when you receive an email, your mail server uses the PTR record that coms with the email to check that the mail server that sent the message matches the IP address that it claims to be using. This is also known as a reverse DNS lookup.




6
DNS
An authoritative answer is when the DNS server hosting the primary copy of the DNS record responds to your lookup. The primary server doesn't always respond to a DNS query to save on network load. Usually, a secondary server will return a cached answer instead.



7
DNS
A resource record, commonly referred to as an RR, is the unit of information entry in DNS zone files; RRs are the basic building blocks of host-name and IP information and are used to resolve all DNS queries. Types include A, AAAA, NS, MX, CNAME, etc.

A negative cache is a cache that also stores "negative" responses, i.e. failures. This means that a program remembers the result indicating a failure even after the cause has been corrected. Usually negative caching is a design choice, but it can also be a design bug.

DNS
A DNS zone is a portion of the DNS namespace that is managed by a specific organization or administrator. It is an administrative space which allows for granular control of DNS components such as authoritative nameservers.
