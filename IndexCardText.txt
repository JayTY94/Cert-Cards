Power BI
Dimension tables are used to filter and group the data in fact tables. The dimension tables, by contrast, contain unique values, for instance, one row for each product in the Products table and one row for each customer in the Customer table.



2
Power BI
Fact tables contain observational or event data values: sales orders, product counts, prices, transactional dates and times, and quantities. Fact tables can contain several repeated values. For example, one product can appear multiple times in multiple rows, for different customers on different dates. These values can be aggregated to create visuals.

Power BI
When you load your data into Power BI, the Autodetect feature will help you establish relationships between columns that are named similarly. Relationships can be inactive or active. Only one active relationship can exist between tables, which is discussed in a future module.

Power BI
The Model view in Power BI desktop provides many options within the column properties that you can view or update. A simple method to get to this menu to update the tables and fields is by Ctrl+clicking or Shift+clicking items on this page.

Power BI
Occasionally, source databases and data warehouses already have their own date tables. If the administrator who designed the database did a thorough job, these tables can be used to perform the following tasks:

Identify company holidays

Separate calendar and fiscal year

Identify weekends versus weekdays



6
Power BI
You can use the Data Analysis Expression (DAX) functions CALENDARAUTO() or CALENDAR() to build your common date table. The CALENDAR() function returns a contiguous range of dates based on a start and end date that are entered as arguments in the function.



7
Power BI
You can use hierarchies as one source to help you find detail in dimension tables. These hierarchies form through natural segments in your data. For instance, you can have a hierarchy of dates in which your dates can be segmented into years, months, weeks, and days.



8
Power BI
The process of viewing multiple child levels based on a top-level parent is known as flattening the hierarchy. In this process, you are creating multiple columns in a table to show the hierarchical path of the parent to the child in the same record.

Power BI
Role-playing dimensions have multiple valid relationships with fact tables, meaning that the same dimension can be used to filter multiple columns or tables of data. As a result, you can filter data differently depending on what information you need to retrieve.



10
Power BI
Data granularity is the detail that is represented within your data, meaning that the more granularity your data has, the greater the level of detail within your data.





11
Power BI
For different scenarios, you could settle on data granularity that is defined weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Generally, the fewer the records that you are working with, the faster your reports and visuals will function. This approach translates to a faster refresh rate for the entire dataset, which might mean that you can refresh more frequently.



12
Power BI
 When you load data, Power BI automatically looks for relationships that exist within the data by matching column names. You can also use Manage Relationships to edit these options manually.



13
Power BI
One-to-one (1:1) cardinality:

Describes a relationship in which only one instance of a value is common between two tables.

Requires unique values in both tables.

Is not recommended because this relationship stores redundant information and suggests that the model is not designed correctly. It is better practice to combine the tables.



14
Power BI
Many-to-many (.) cardinality:

Describes a relationship where many values are in common between two tables.

Does not require unique values in either table in a relationship.

Is not recommended; a lack of unique values introduces ambiguity and your users might not know which column of values is referring to what.



15
Power BI
Follow the direction of the arrow on the relationship between your tables to know which direction the filter will flow. You typically want these arrows to point to your fact table.



16
Power BI
Consider the scenario where you are tasked with building a visual that examines budgets for customers and accounts. You can have multiple customers on the same account and multiple accounts with the same customer, so you know that you need to create a many-to-many relationship.





17
Power BI
Modeling data is about establishing and maintaining relationships so that you can effectively visualize the data in the form that your business requires. When you are creating these relationships, a common pitfall that you might encounter are circular relationships.



18
Power BI
Sales[‘TotalCost] = Sales[‘Quantity’] * Sales[‘Price’]

TotalCost depends on Quantity and Price, so if a change occurs in either quantity or price, a change will occur in TotalCost as well. This example outlines a dependency of a column on other columns, but you can also have dependencies between measures, tables, and relationships.



19
Power BI
The labs in docs.microsoft learn use a shorthand notation to reference a field. It looks like this: Product | Category. In this example, Product is the table name and Category is the field name.



20
Power BI
Active relationships will propagate filters. It's possible to mark a relationship as inactive so filters don't propagate. Inactive relationships can exist when there are multiple relationship paths between tables. In which case, model calculations can use special functions to activate them.



21
Power BI
Fact tables contain observational data while dimension tables contain information about specific entities within the data.
