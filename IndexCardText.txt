You can take advantage of Amazon S3's bucket notification feature and direct S3 to publish object-created events to AWS Lambda. Whenever CloudTrail writes a log to your S3 bucket, S3 can then invoke your lambda function by passing the S3 object-created event as a parameter.

You can aggregate statistics for your EC2 instances that have detailed monitoring enabled. Instances that use basic montoring are not included. Therefore, you must enable detailed monitoring (at an additional charge), which provides data in 1-minute periods.
