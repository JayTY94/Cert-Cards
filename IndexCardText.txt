For example, to allow Agents to connect between  t he hours of 1:00 and 6:00 only, select 01:00 from the first drop-down list, and 06:00 from the second drop down list. You can set the communications window to avoid times hwen your devices are busiest.

SNMP traps are messages initiated by network devices and sent to the trap receiver on the appliance. For example, a router can send a message when its power supply fails. Or, a printer initiates a message when it runs out of paper. The appliance receives these traps adn generates alerts when certain pre-defined thresholds are reached.

Conditional Access
Conditional Access policies at their simplest are if-then statements, if a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action. Example: A payroll manager wants to access the payroll application and is required to do multi-factor authentication to access it.




27
Conditional Access
Conditional Access policies are enforced after first-factor authentication is completed. Conditional Access isn't intended to be an organization's first line of defense for scenarios like denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, but it can use signals from these events to determine access.




28
Conditional Access
Common Signal: User or Group Membership
Policies can be targeted to specific users and groups giving administrators fine-grained control over access.



29
Conditional Access
Common Signal: IP Location Information
Organizations can created trusted IP ranges that can be used when making policy decisions.
Administrators can specify entire countries/regions IP ranges to block or allow traffic from.




30
Conditional Access
Common Signal: Device
Users with devices of specific platforms or marked with a specific state can be used when enforcing Conditional Access policies.

Power BI
A Power BI dataset can operate in one of the following modes to access datta from a variety of data sources.

Import mode
DirectQuery mode
LiveConnect mode
Push mode



3
Power BI
DirectQuery datasets and datasets in LiveConnect mode to Analysis Services don't import data; they query the underlying data source with every user interaction.



4

A Power BI refresh operation can consists of multiple refresh types, including data refresh, OneDrive refresh, refresh of query caches, tile refresh, and refresh of report visuals.



6
Power BI
You can trigger an on-demand refresh by selecting Refresh now in the dataset menu. On-demand refreshes are not included in the refresh limitation.



7
Power BI
Data refreshes must complete in less than 2 hours on shred capacity. On Premium, the maximum refresh duration is 5 hours.



8
Power BI
If you created your datasets and reports based on a Power BI Desktop file, Excel workbook, or comma separated value (.csv) file on OneDrive or SharePoint Online, Power BI performs another type of refresh, known as OneDrive refresh.


9
Power BI
Power BI maintains a cache for every tile visual on your dashboards and proactively updates the tile caches when data changes. In other words, tile refresh happens automatically following a data refresh.



10
Power BI
A data source definition provides Power BI with the connection information for a given source, including connection endpoints, authentication mode, and credentials.
