DNS
A PTR (or Pointer) record is a security tool. Essentially, when you receive an email, your mail server uses the PTR record that comes with the email to check that the mail server that sent the message matches the IP address that it claims to be using. This is also known as a reverse DNS lookup.

DNS
An authoritative answer is when the DNS server hosting the primary copy of the DNS record responds to your lookup. The primary server doesn't always respond to a DNS query to save on network load. Usually, a secondary server will return a cached answer instead.

DNS
A resource record, commonly referred to as an RR, is the unit of information entry in DNS zone files; RRs are the basic building blocks of host-name and IP information and are used to resolve all DNS queries. Types include A, AAAA, NS, MX, CNAME, etc.

A negative cache is a cache that also stores "negative" responses, i.e. failures. This means that a program remembers the result indicating a failure even after the cause has been corrected. Usually negative caching is a design choice, but it can also be a design bug.

DNS
A DNS zone is a portion of the DNS namespace that is managed by a specific organization or administrator. It is an administrative space which allows for granular control of DNS components such as authoritative nameservers.

If your Internet-facing load balancer in a VPC is not responding to requests, check for the following:
Your Internet-facing load balancer is attached to a private subnet – Verify that you specified public subnets for your load balancer. A public subnet has a route to the Internet Gateway for your virtual private cloud (VPC).



11
AWS SysOps Admin
If your Internet-facing load balancer in a VPC is not responding to requests, check for the following:
· A security group or network ACL does not allow traffic – The security group for the load balancer and any network ACLs for the load balancer subnets must allow inbound traffic from the clients and outbound traffic to the clients on the listener ports




12
AWS SysOps Admin
AWS WAF can be executed at edge locations on Amazon CloudFront or at Application Load Balancers at regional level. A question asked that a Web ACL be executed at farthest point from Web application. It needs to apply at an Amazon CloudFront edge location at Global level.

The Amazon EC2 instances you launch into a nondefault VPC are private by default; they’re not assigned a public IPv4 address unless you specifically assign one during launch, or you modify the subnet’s public IPv4 address attribute.



14
AWS SysOps Admin
By default, all EC2 instances in a nondefault VPC receive an unresolvable host name that AWS assigns (for example, ip-10-0-0-202). You can assign your own domain name to your instances and use up to four of your own DNS servers. To do that, you must specify a special set of DHCP options to use with the VPC.

To increase availability & enable users to enhance Read performance by reading data from the nearest Regions, Read Replicas can be created for Amazon Aurora MySQL database. Up to 5 Read Replicas can be created for both encrypted & unencrypted DB clusters in different AWS regions.



16
AWS SysOps Admin
While ordinary Amazon Route 53 records are standard DNS records, alias records provide a Route 53-specific extension to DNS functionality. Instaed of an IP address or a domain name, an alias record contains a pointer to an AWS resource such as a CloudFront distribution or an Amazon S3 bucket.

Listeners

Incoming traffic is evaluated against listeners. Listeners evaluate any traffic that matches the Listener's port. For Classic Load Balancers, EC2 instances are directly registered to the Load Balancer.



18
AWS SysOps Admin
ELB Rules (Not available for Classic Load Balancer)
Listeners will then invoke rules to decide what to do with new traffic. Generally, the next step is to forward traffic to a Target Group.
Example: redirect traffic headed for port 80 to port 443.



19
AWS SysOps Admin
ELB Target Groups  (Not available for CLassic Load Balancer)
EC2 instances are registered as targets to a Target Group.



20
AWS SysOps Admin
For Classic Load Balancers (CLB), traffic is sent to Listeners. When the port matches it, it then forwards the traffic to any EC2 instances that are registered to teh Classic Laod Balancer. CLB does nto allow you to apply rules to listeners.

Application Load Balancers (ALB) are designed to balance HTTP and HTTPS traffic. They operate at Layer 7 of the OSI model.




22
AWS SysOps Admin
ALB has a feature called Request Routing which allows you to add routing rules to yoru listeners based on the HTTP protocol.




23
AWS SysOps Admin
Web Application Firewall (WAF) can be attached to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). ALBs are great for Web Applications.




24
AWS SysOps Admin
Network Load Balancers (NLB) are designed to balance TCP/UDP traffic. They operate at Layer 4 of the OSI model.



25
AWS SysOps Admin
Network Load Balancers (NLB) can handle millions of requests per second while maintaining extremely low latency. They are great for Multiplayer video games or when network performance is critical.




26
AWS SysOps Admin
Classic Load Balancers (CLB) was AWS' first load balancer (legacy). It is not recommended for use; instead use NLB or ALB.




27
AWS SysOps Admin
Classic Load Balancers (CLB) can balance HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP traffic (not at the same time)




28
AWS SysOps Admin
Classic Load Balancers (CLB) can use Layer 7-specific features such as sticky sessions. It can also use strict layer 4 balancing fore purely TCP applications.




29
AWS SysOps Admin
NLBs and CLBs can be used for cross-zone laod balancing.




30
AWS SysOps Admin
Classic Load Balancers (CLB) will respond with a 504 error (timeout) if the underlying application is not responding at the web-server or database level.

Sticky Sessions is an advanced load balancing method that allows you to bind a user's session to a specific EC2 instance. It ensures all requests from that session are sent to the same instance.



2
AWS SysOps Admin
Sticky Sessions are typically used with a Classic Load Balancer (CLB). It can be used with an ALB, though it can only be set to a target group; not individual EC2 instances. It is not available for NLB.



3
AWS SysOps Admin
With sticy sessions, cookies are used to remember which EC2 instance the user is working wiht. It is usefull when specific information isn only stored locally on a single instance.




4
AWS SysOps Admin
The X-Forwarded-For (XXF) header is a command method for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or a load balancer. Use it if you need the IPv4 address of a user.




5
AWS SysOps Admin
Instances that are monitored by the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) report back Health Checks as InService or OutofService. Health Checks communicate directly with the instance to determine its state.



6
AWS SysOps Admin
ELB does not terminate (kill) unhealthy instances. It will just redirect traffic to healthy instances.




7
AWS SysOps Admin
For ALB and NLB, the Health Checkcs are found on the Target Group.




8
AWS SysOps Admin
Cross-Zone Load Balancing only works for Classic and Network Load Balancers.




9
AWS SysOps Admin
When Cross-Zone Load balancing is enabled, requests are distributed evently across the instances in all enabled Availability Zones. The example for this shows an ELB sending traffic to other ELB nodes in different AZs.

ALB Request Routing: Applies rules to incoming requests and hten forwards or redirects traffic. It can look at the following:
Host header
Source IP
Path
Http header
Http header method
Query String
