VPC Endpoints help keep traffic between AWS services within the AWS Network.



2
AWS SysOps Admin
There are two kinds of VPC Endpoints: Interface Endpoints and Gateway Endpoints.




3
AWS SysOps Admin
Interface Endpoints cost money. Gateway endpoints are free.




4
AWS SysOps Admin
Interface Endpoints use an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) with Private IP (powered by AWS PrivateLink).




5
AWS SysOps Admin
A Gateway Endpoint is a target for a specific route in your route table.



6
AWS SysOps Admin
Interface Endpoints support many AWS services, while Gateway Endpoints support only DynamoDB and S3




7
AWS SysOps Admin
VPC Flow Logs monitor the in-and-out traffic of your Network Interfaces within your VPC.




8
AWS SysOps Admin
You can turn on Flow Logs at the VPC level, Subnet level, or Network Interface level.




9
AWS SysOps Admin
VPC Flow Logs cannot be tagged like other AWS resources.



10
AWS SysOps Admin
You cannot change the configuration of a flow log after it's created.



11
AWS SysOps Admin
You cannot enable flow logs for VPCs which are peered with your VPCs unless it is in the same account.



12
AWS SysOps Admin
VPC Flow Logs can be delivered to an S3 bucket or CLoudWatch Logs.



13
AWS SysOps Admin
Some instance traffic is not monitored by VPC Flow Logs:
Instance traffic generated by contacting the AWS DNS servers
Windows License activation traffic from instances.



14
AWS SysOps Admin
Some instance traffic is not monitored by VPC Flow Logs:
Traffic to and from the instance metadata address (169.254.169.254)
DHCP traffic
Any traffic to the reserved IP address of the default VPC router




15
AWS SysOps Admin
RDS will not automatically failover from a primary instance to a secondary instance in the case of a long running query or a Database corruption error. These require manual failovers.




16
AWS SysOps Admin
A company wants to establish a hybrid connection between an On-premises data center and a VPC hosted in AWS. They want to bear the least cost for this connectivity and implement the solution quickly.

They should  use AWS VPN Managed Connections

not

AWS Direct Connect Gateway




17
AWS SysOps Admin
On an S3 bucket, the "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent" condition key can be used to grant/restrict users from deleting items in the s3 bucket. This is different from MFA Delete because the MFA device referred to with MFA Delete is the device for the root credentials.




18
AWS SysOps Admin
Amazon Glacier data can be retrieved in 1-5 minutes with expedited retrievals.




19
AWS SysOps Admin
A SysOps Administrator is auditing the OS patching process of Amazon RDS instances as part of the organization's internal annual review process. This can be done from the Amazon RDS console in the dashboard.



20
AWS SysOps Admin
Using an Application Load Balancer instead of a Classic Load Balancer allows for path-based routing. You can configure rules for your listener that forward requests based on the URL in the request. This enables you to structure your application as smaller services and route requests to the correct service based on the content of the URL.



21
AWS SysOps Admin
Using an ALB instead of a CLB allows for host-based routing. You can configure rules for your listener that forward requests based on the host field in the HTTP header. This enables you to route requests to multiple domains using a single load balancer.



22
AWS SysOps Admin
A company has been using an AWS RDS-MySQL Instance. There is a new requirement to disable backups for the AWS RDS instance. You try to set the retention period to 0 to disable backups, but this results in an error. Which of the following could be the possible reason for the error?

There is a Read replica in place.




23
AWS SysOps Admin
If you try to disable RDS automatic backups by setting the retention period to 0 and receive a message saying that the retention period must be between 1 and 35, check to make sure that you haven't set up a read replica for the instance. Read replicas require backups for managing read replica logs.




24
AWS SysOps Admin
With AWS CloudFormation StackStes, stacks can be created in multiple AWS accounts in different regions using a single AWS CloudFormation Template. The template defines all resources along with all parameters. The Stackset can be used to create, update, and delete stacks in multiple accounts and across regions.




25
AWS SysOps Admin
While creating AWS CloudFormation Templates for DB instances or any resource, we can specify NoEcho in parameters to hide the value to be displayed. For example, set NoEcho to True when hiding a password or similar parameter.




26
AWS SysOps Admin
RDS instances are managed by AWS. You cannot SSH into the VM running the database.




27
AWS SysOps Admin
There are 6 relational database options currently available on AWS:

Aurora
MySQL
MariaDB
Postgres
Oracle
Microsoft SQL Server




28
AWS SysOps Admin
RDS Multi-AZ is an option you can turn on which makes an exact copy of your database in another AZ that is for standby only.



29
AWS SysOps Admin
For RDS Multi-AZ, AWS automatically synchronizes changes in the database over to the standby copy.




30
AWS SysOps Admin
RDS Multi-AZ has Automatic Failover protection. If one AZ goes down, failover will occur, and the standby slave will be promoted to master.

AWS SysOps Admin
RDS Read Replicas allow you to run multiple copies of your database. These copies only allow reads (no writes) and are intended to alleviate the workload of your primary database and improve performance.



2
AWS SysOps Admin
RDS Read Replicas use Asynchronous replication




3
AWS SysOps Admin
You must have automatic backups enabled to use read replicas with RDS.




4
AWS SysOps Admin
RDS can have up to 5 read replicas at a time




5
AWS SysOps Admin
RDS can combine read replicas and multi-AZ




6
AWS SysOps Admin
RDS can have read replicas in another region, called Cross-Region Read Replicas.




7
AWS SysOps Admin
RDS Multi-AZ replicas can be promoted to their own database, but this breaks replication.




8
AWS SysOps Admin
You can have Multi-AZ replicas of read replicas




9
AWS SysOps Admin
RDS has 2 backup solutions: Automated Backs and Database Snapshots



10
AWS SysOps Admin
With RDS Automated Backups, you choose a retention period between 1 and 35 days. There is no additional cost for backup storage. You define your backup window.




11
AWS SysOps Admin
With RDS Manual Snapshots, you manually create backups. If you delete your primary, the manual snapshots will still exist and can be restored.



12
AWS SysOps Admin
When you restore an RDS instance, it will create a new database. You will need to delete your old database and point new traffic to the new database restored from the backup.




13
AWS SysOps Admin
You can turn on encryption at-rest for RDS via KMS.
