For different scenarios, you could settle on data granularity that is defined weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Generally, the fewer the records that you are working with, the faster your reports and visuals will function. This approach translates to a faster refresh rate for the entire dataset, which might mean that you can refresh more frequently.

Power BI
 When you load data, Power BI automatically looks for relationships that exist within the data by matching column names. You can also use Manage Relationships to edit these options manually.



13
Power BI
One-to-one (1:1) cardinality:

Describes a relationship in which only one instance of a value is common between two tables.

Requires unique values in both tables.

Is not recommended because this relationship stores redundant information and suggests that the model is not designed correctly. It is better practice to combine the tables.



14
Power BI
Many-to-many (.) cardinality:

Describes a relationship where many values are in common between two tables.

Does not require unique values in either table in a relationship.

Is not recommended; a lack of unique values introduces ambiguity and your users might not know which column of values is referring to what.



15
Power BI
Follow the direction of the arrow on the relationship between your tables to know which direction the filter will flow. You typically want these arrows to point to your fact table.



16
Power BI
Consider the scenario where you are tasked with building a visual that examines budgets for customers and accounts. You can have multiple customers on the same account and multiple accounts with the same customer, so you know that you need to create a many-to-many relationship.





17
Power BI
Modeling data is about establishing and maintaining relationships so that you can effectively visualize the data in the form that your business requires. When you are creating these relationships, a common pitfall that you might encounter are circular relationships.



18
Power BI
Sales[‘TotalCost] = Sales[‘Quantity’] * Sales[‘Price’]

TotalCost depends on Quantity and Price, so if a change occurs in either quantity or price, a change will occur in TotalCost as well. This example outlines a dependency of a column on other columns, but you can also have dependencies between measures, tables, and relationships.



19
Power BI
The labs in docs.microsoft learn use a shorthand notation to reference a field. It looks like this: Product | Category. In this example, Product is the table name and Category is the field name.



20
Power BI
Active relationships will propagate filters. It's possible to mark a relationship as inactive so filters don't propagate. Inactive relationships can exist when there are multiple relationship paths between tables. In which case, model calculations can use special functions to activate them.



21
Power BI
Fact tables contain observational data while dimension tables contain information about specific entities within the data.



22
Power BI
Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is a programming language that is used throughout Microsoft Power BI for creating calculated columns, measures, and custom tables. It is a collection of functions, operators, and constants that can be used in a formula, or expression, to calculate and return one or more values.



23
Power BI
Calculated columns are materialized in the .pbix Power BI file extension, meaning that each time you add a calculated column, you are increasing the size of the overall file. Having too many calculated columns will slow performance and will cause you to reach the maximum Power BI file size sooner.


24
Power BI
X functions, such as SUMX, COUNTX, MINX, are called iterator functions because, though they are used in measures, they iterate over the individual rows to do their calculations. An X function will perform better and use less disk space than a calculated column.



25
Power BI
Measures are calculated on demand. Power BI calculates the correct value when the user requests it. Measures do not add to the overall disk space of the Power BI .pbix file.





26
Power BI
The CALCULATE function is your method of creating a DAX measure that will override certain portions of the context that are being used to express the correct result.

For instance, if you want to create a measure that always calculates the total sales for 2015, regardless of which year is selected in any other visual in Power BI, you would create a measure that looks like the following sample:

Total Sales for 2015 = CALCULATE(SUM('Sales OrderDetails'[Total Price]), YEAR('Sales OrderDetails'[orderdate]) = 2015)



27
Power BI
To create this measure for Sales by Ship Date, you can use the DAX function USERELATIONSHIP(). This function is used to specify a relationship to be used in a specific calculation and is done without overriding any existing relationships. It is a beneficial feature in that it allows developers to make additional calculations on inactive relationships by overriding the default active relationship between two tables in a DAX expression, as shown in the following example:

Sales by Ship Date = CALCULATE(Sum(Sales[TotalPrice]), USERELATIONSHIP(Sales[ShipDate],'Calendar'[Date]))



28
Power BI
Occasionally, summing a measure doesn't make sense, such as when you are performing inventory counts in a warehouse. For example, if on Monday, you have 100 mountain bikes, and on Tuesday you have 125 mountain bikes, you wouldn't want to add those together to indicate that you had 225 mountain bikes between those two days. In this circumstance, if you want to know your stock levels for March, you would need to tell Power BI not to add the measure but instead take the last value for the month of March and assign it to any visual.





29
Power BI
The YTD Total Sales measure uses a built-in DAX function called TOTALYTD. This function takes an argument for the type of calculation. You can use the SUM function to get the Total Price, as you've done throughout this module. The second argument that you want to operate over is the Dates field. You can use your Dates table and add this measure to your visual, and you'll get the running total result that you're looking for. Y



30
Power BI
The matrix visual is similar to a table. A table supports two dimensions and the data is flat, meaning duplicate values are displayed and not aggregated. A matrix makes it easier to display data meaningfully across multiple dimensions -- it supports a stepped layout. The matrix automatically aggregates the data and enables you to drill down.
