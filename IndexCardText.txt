We can use ‘Invoke Process’ to execute a process which is available for the local machine. The parent process waits for the child process to complete before resuming.

Run Parallel Process lets us invoke a local process which executes alongside the caller process. In the Process Name property of the activity, we must enter the package name. We can pass data to the invoked parallel process, but we cannot retrieve data, the only available argument direction is in.

When creating a trigger scope activity with a switch statement, remember to
1. Assign args.TriggerName to a str variable
2. Add Switch statements
3. Change TypeArgument in Properties panel to String

This is if you're using the names of the triggers to identify which trigger fired.

A transaction represents the minimum (atomic) amount of data and the necessary steps required to process the data, by fulfilling a section of a business process. A typical example would be a process that reads a single email from a mailbox and extracts data from it.



We call the data atomic because once it is processed, the assumption is that we no longer need it as we advance with the business process.

The steps of the process are performed multiple times, but each time different data items are used.

This kind of process can be implemented with a simple loop, but it has the disadvantage that, if a problem happens when processing one item, the whole process is interrupted and the other items remain unprocessed.

Triggers enable the execution of jobs in a structured manner. There are two types of triggers:

Time triggers: with these, you can schedule the recurrent execution of a process.
Queue triggers: these enable the execution of a process based on the new items added to a queue.

In Orchestrator, an SLA takes the form of a time interval (expressed in days and/or hours) in which a queue item has to be processed. The Risk SLA is a subsequent concept in Orchestrator, meant to identify the point in which corrective action needs to be taken to avoid breaching the SLA.

Consider an item added to a queue at 17:00. The average processing time of the queue is 45 minutes. The SLA is 3 hours and the risk SLA is 2 hours. If a robot picks it up at 19:00, what would the status of the queue item be?

In SLA, at risk
