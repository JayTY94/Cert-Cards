Fact tables contain observational data while dimension tables contain information about specific entities within the data.

Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is a programming language that is used throughout Microsoft Power BI for creating calculated columns, measures, and custom tables. It is a collection of functions, operators, and constants that can be used in a formula, or expression, to calculate and return one or more values.



23
Power BI
Calculated columns are materialized in the .pbix Power BI file extension, meaning that each time you add a calculated column, you are increasing the size of the overall file. Having too many calculated columns will slow performance and will cause you to reach the maximum Power BI file size sooner.

Power BI
X functions, such as SUMX, COUNTX, MINX, are called iterator functions because, though they are used in measures, they iterate over the individual rows to do their calculations. An X function will perform better and use less disk space than a calculated column.



25
Power BI
Measures are calculated on demand. Power BI calculates the correct value when the user requests it. Measures do not add to the overall disk space of the Power BI .pbix file.

The CALCULATE function is your method of creating a DAX measure that will override certain portions of the context that are being used to express the correct result.

For instance, if you want to create a measure that always calculates the total sales for 2015, regardless of which year is selected in any other visual in Power BI, you would create a measure that looks like the following sample:

Total Sales for 2015 = CALCULATE(SUM('Sales OrderDetails'[Total Price]), YEAR('Sales OrderDetails'[orderdate]) = 2015)



27
Power BI
To create this measure for Sales by Ship Date, you can use the DAX function USERELATIONSHIP(). This function is used to specify a relationship to be used in a specific calculation and is done without overriding any existing relationships. It is a beneficial feature in that it allows developers to make additional calculations on inactive relationships by overriding the default active relationship between two tables in a DAX expression, as shown in the following example:

Sales by Ship Date = CALCULATE(Sum(Sales[TotalPrice]), USERELATIONSHIP(Sales[ShipDate],'Calendar'[Date]))



28
Power BI
Occasionally, summing a measure doesn't make sense, such as when you are performing inventory counts in a warehouse. For example, if on Monday, you have 100 mountain bikes, and on Tuesday you have 125 mountain bikes, you wouldn't want to add those together to indicate that you had 225 mountain bikes between those two days. In this circumstance, if you want to know your stock levels for March, you would need to tell Power BI not to add the measure but instead take the last value for the month of March and assign it to any visual.





29
Power BI
The YTD Total Sales measure uses a built-in DAX function called TOTALYTD. This function takes an argument for the type of calculation. You can use the SUM function to get the Total Price, as you've done throughout this module. The second argument that you want to operate over is the Dates field. You can use your Dates table and add this measure to your visual, and you'll get the running total result that you're looking for. Y

Power BI
The matrix visual is similar to a table. A table supports two dimensions and the data is flat, meaning duplicate values are displayed and not aggregated. A matrix makes it easier to display data meaningfully across multiple dimensions -- it supports a stepped layout. The matrix automatically aggregates the data and enables you to drill down.
