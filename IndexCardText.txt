Cloud formation Change sets
If you need to make changes to the running resources in a stack, you update the stack. Before making changes to your resources, you can generate a change set, which is a summary of your proposed changes. Change sets allow you to see how your changes might impact your running resources, especially for critical resources, before implementing them.

AWS SysOps Admin
In CloudFormation, a resource declaration begins with a string that specifies the logical name for that resource. The logical name can be used to refer to resources within the template.

18
AWS SysOps Admin
You use the Parameters section of a CloudFormation template to declare values that can be passed to the template when you create the stack. A parameter is an effective way to specify sensitive information, such as user names and passwords, that you don't want to store in the template itself



19
AWS SysOps Admin
Parameters in a CloudFormation template provide a way to specify information that might be unique to the specific application or configuration you are deploying, for example, a domain name or instance type.

Making KACE tickets in the portal for some reason does not notify the ticket owner. Alan just emails helpdesk@hemic.com and then adjusts the values afterward.



21
AWS SysOps Admin
If CloudFormation can't create a resource, it reports a CREATE_FAILED event and, by default, rolls back the stack and deletes any resources that have been created. The Status Reason column displays the issue that caused the failure.
