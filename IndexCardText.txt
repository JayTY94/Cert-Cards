Triggers enable the execution of jobs in a structured manner. There are two types of triggers:

Time triggers: with these, you can schedule the recurrent execution of a process.
Queue triggers: these enable the execution of a process based on the new items added to a queue.

In Orchestrator, an SLA takes the form of a time interval (expressed in days and/or hours) in which a queue item has to be processed. The Risk SLA is a subsequent concept in Orchestrator, meant to identify the point in which corrective action needs to be taken to avoid breaching the SLA.

UiPath Advanced Developer
Consider an item added to a queue at 17:00. The average processing time of the queue is 45 minutes. The SLA is 3 hours and the risk SLA is 2 hours. If a robot picks it up at 19:00, what would the status of the queue item be?

In SLA, at risk

Long-term support (LTS) is a product lifecycle management policy in which a stable release of computer software is maintained for a longer period of time than the standard edition. The term is typically reserved for open-source software, where it describes a software edition that is supported for months or years longer than the software's standard edition.
