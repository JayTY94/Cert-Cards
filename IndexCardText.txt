A Business Exception describes an error rooted in the fact that certain data which the automation project depends on is incomplete or missing.

An Application Exception describes an error rooted in a technical issue, such as an application that is not responding.

These kinds of issues have a chance of being solved simply by retrying the transaction, as the application can unfreeze.
