The block user input activity prevents the user from interrupting the automation with mouse movements or keystrokes. This isolation mode is used when the process needs to ensure it is not interrupted by the user logged into the machine.

The Simulate and Send Window message activities allow automations that run in an isolated mode to interact with an application without mouse or keyboard hardware involvement.

The picture-in-picture (PiP) mode runs attended automations in a separate, isolated window that provides a realtime display of the work being performed.

The Invoke Processes activity executes a UiPath process that is available for the local machine. Can be used to run local packages, as well as processes in Orchestrator, if a connection is available.

BlockUser activity -
Once the designated hotkey combination for reactivating user input is pressed, and user input is restored, it cannot be blocked again during the same runtime. The hotkey combination is implemented as a safeguard against blocking yourself from stopping the workflow while developing it.

With SimulateType set as the input method for each of these activities, the automation can run without capturing the user's keyboard and mouse and they won’t need to worry that they might interfere with the log in process.

It's worth noting that Microsoft Office applications in general do not run successfully in Picture-in-Picture mode if they are already open in the user's main session.  

For automations which use both the PiP mode and Office products, either ensure they are closed in the user's session, or change the Target Session of the workflow that uses the apps to Main.



16
UiPath Advanced Developer

Only one Picture-in-Picture session can be started at a time on the same machine.

Run as administrator cannot be used in PiP sessions.

The machine cannot be restarted or shut down while the PiP session is opened as the PiP session needs to be closed beforehand.

The Background Process is a template for creating processes that can run in parallel on the same Robot, together with one foreground process. For this reason, background processes must not contain activities that require UI Interaction activities like Click and Type Into.

A fired trigger passes arguments to the group of activities that run. These arguments contain information about the event, including the name of the trigger, the trigger type, and an event info object that enables us to extract different types of data about the trigger and its target.

 If we start a background process with a foreground scope and another entity is running in the foreground (either a process or another foreground scope), the background process goes into a queue and waits, determined by the ‘Wait for foreground’ property, to acquire foreground.

We can use ‘Invoke Process’ to execute a process which is available for the local machine. The parent process waits for the child process to complete before resuming.

Run Parallel Process lets us invoke a local process which executes alongside the caller process. In the Process Name property of the activity, we must enter the package name. We can pass data to the invoked parallel process, but we cannot retrieve data, the only available argument direction is in.

When creating a trigger scope activity with a switch statement, remember to
1. Assign args.TriggerName to a str variable
2. Add Switch statements
3. Change TypeArgument in Properties panel to String

This is if you're using the names of the triggers to identify which trigger fired.

A transaction represents the minimum (atomic) amount of data and the necessary steps required to process the data, by fulfilling a section of a business process. A typical example would be a process that reads a single email from a mailbox and extracts data from it.



We call the data atomic because once it is processed, the assumption is that we no longer need it as we advance with the business process.



30
UiPath Advanced Developer
The steps of the process are performed multiple times, but each time different data items are used.

This kind of process can be implemented with a simple loop, but it has the disadvantage that, if a problem happens when processing one item, the whole process is interrupted and the other items remain unprocessed.

Triggers enable the execution of jobs in a structured manner. There are two types of triggers:

Time triggers: with these, you can schedule the recurrent execution of a process.
Queue triggers: these enable the execution of a process based on the new items added to a queue.

UiPath Advanced Developer
In Orchestrator, an SLA takes the form of a time interval (expressed in days and/or hours) in which a queue item has to be processed. The Risk SLA is a subsequent concept in Orchestrator, meant to identify the point in which corrective action needs to be taken to avoid breaching the SLA.

UiPath Advanced Developer
Consider an item added to a queue at 17:00. The average processing time of the queue is 45 minutes. The SLA is 3 hours and the risk SLA is 2 hours. If a robot picks it up at 19:00, what would the status of the queue item be?

In SLA, at risk
