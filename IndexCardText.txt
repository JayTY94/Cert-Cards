Sticky Sessions is an advanced load balancing method that allows you to bind a user's session to a specific EC2 instance. It ensures all requests from that session are sent to the same instance.



2
AWS SysOps Admin
Sticky Sessions are typically used with a Classic Load Balancer (CLB). It can be used with an ALB, though it can only be set to a target group; not individual EC2 instances. It is not available for NLB.

With sticy sessions, cookies are used to remember which EC2 instance the user is working wiht. It is usefull when specific information isn only stored locally on a single instance.

The X-Forwarded-For (XXF) header is a command method for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or a load balancer. Use it if you need the IPv4 address of a user.

Instances that are monitored by the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) report back Health Checks as InService or OutofService. Health Checks communicate directly with the instance to determine its state.

ELB does not terminate (kill) unhealthy instances. It will just redirect traffic to healthy instances.

For ALB and NLB, the Health Checkcs are found on the Target Group.

Cross-Zone Load Balancing only works for Classic and Network Load Balancers.




9
AWS SysOps Admin
When Cross-Zone Load balancing is enabled, requests are distributed evently across the instances in all enabled Availability Zones. The example for this shows an ELB sending traffic to other ELB nodes in different AZs.

ALB Request Routing: Applies rules to incoming requests and hten forwards or redirects traffic. It can look at the following:
Host header
Source IP
Path
Http header
Http header method
Query String

The Run to this Activity option is avialable when right-clicking an activity in the Designer panel.

This option starts the debugging process and pauses before teh selected activity is executed while highlighting it in the panel. If Run to this Activity is triggered when debugging is already paused, the execution continues until the activity is reached.

UiPath
Use Step Into to debug activities one at a time. When this action is triggered, the debugger opens and highlights hte activity before it is executed.

When Step Into is used with Invoke Workflow File activities, the workflow is opened in a new tab in ReadOnly mode and each activity is executed one by one.

The keyboard shortcut for Step Into is F11.



13
UiPath
Unlike the Step Into action, Step Over does not open the current container. When used, the action debugs the next activity, highlighting containers (such as flowcharts, sequences or Invoke Workflow File activities) without opening thme.

This action comes in handy for skipping analysis of large containers which are unlikely to trigger any issues during execution.

Step Over is available using the F10 keybaord shortcut.
