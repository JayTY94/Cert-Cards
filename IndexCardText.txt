Sticky Sessions is an advanced load balancing method that allows you to bind a user's session to a specific EC2 instance. It ensures all requests from that session are sent to the same instance.



2
AWS SysOps Admin
Sticky Sessions are typically used with a Classic Load Balancer (CLB). It can be used with an ALB, though it can only be set to a target group; not individual EC2 instances. It is not available for NLB.



3
AWS SysOps Admin
With sticy sessions, cookies are used to remember which EC2 instance the user is working wiht. It is usefull when specific information isn only stored locally on a single instance.

AWS SysOps Admin
The X-Forwarded-For (XXF) header is a command method for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or a load balancer. Use it if you need the IPv4 address of a user.




5
AWS SysOps Admin
Instances that are monitored by the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) report back Health Checks as InService or OutofService. Health Checks communicate directly with the instance to determine its state.



6
AWS SysOps Admin
ELB does not terminate (kill) unhealthy instances. It will just redirect traffic to healthy instances.




7
AWS SysOps Admin
For ALB and NLB, the Health Checkcs are found on the Target Group.

AWS SysOps Admin
Cross-Zone Load Balancing only works for Classic and Network Load Balancers.




9
AWS SysOps Admin
When Cross-Zone Load balancing is enabled, requests are distributed evently across the instances in all enabled Availability Zones. The example for this shows an ELB sending traffic to other ELB nodes in different AZs.

ALB Request Routing: Applies rules to incoming requests and hten forwards or redirects traffic. It can look at the following:
Host header
Source IP
Path
Http header
Http header method
Query String

The Run to this Activity option is avialable when right-clicking an activity in the Designer panel.

This option starts the debugging process and pauses before teh selected activity is executed while highlighting it in the panel. If Run to this Activity is triggered when debugging is already paused, the execution continues until the activity is reached.



12
UiPath
Use Step Into to debug activities one at a time. When this action is triggered, the debugger opens and highlights hte activity before it is executed.

When Step Into is used with Invoke Workflow File activities, the workflow is opened in a new tab in ReadOnly mode and each activity is executed one by one.

The keyboard shortcut for Step Into is F11.



13
UiPath
Unlike the Step Into action, Step Over does not open the current container. When used, the action debugs the next activity, highlighting containers (such as flowcharts, sequences or Invoke Workflow File activities) without opening thme.

This action comes in handy for skipping analysis of large containers which are unlikely to trigger any issues during execution.

Step Over is available using the F10 keybaord shortcut.

Escaping XML Data
Adding control characters ('<', '>', ''', '"', '&') into xml data can cause the parser to miss understand the resulting data. The solution is to escape the control characters so that the parser can interpret them correctly as data, and not confuse them for markup.

The following is a list of all the built in replacements

Char	Escape String
<	&lt;
>	&gt;
"	&quot;
'	&apos;

If you get an InsufficientInstanceCapacity error when you try to launch an instance or restart a stopped instance, AWS does not currently have enough available On-Demand capacity to service your request.

To resolve the issue, try the following.
Wait a few minutes and then submit your request again; Capacity can shift frequently.




16
AWS SysOps Admin
If you get an InsufficientInstanceCapacity error when you try to launch an instance or restart a stopped instance, AWS does not currently have enough available On-Demand capacity to service your request.

To resolve the issue, try the following.
If you're launching an instance, submit a new request using a different instance type (which you can resize at a later stage)



17
AWS SysOps Admin
With step scaling policies, you can specify the number of seconds that it takes for a newly launched instance to warm up. Until its specified warm-up time has expired, an instance is not counted toward the aggregated metrics of the Auto Scaling group.




18
AWS SysOps Admin
While scaling out, AWS also does not consider instances that are warming up as part of hte current capacity of the group. Therefore, multiple alarm breaches that fall in the range of the same step adjustment result in a single scaling activity. This ensures that we don't add more instances than you need.

Your company is planning on hosting a set of databases using AWS RDS. The IT security department has mandated that all traffic is encrypted in transit. How can you achieve this?

Use the SSL certificates provided by the AWS RDS service.
Set the Parameter Group for the RDS instance.

An archive is any object, such as a photo, video, or document, that you store in a vault. It is a base unit of storage in Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier). Each archive has a unique ID and an optional description.

Example archive ID:
TJgHcrOSfAkV6hdPqOATYfp_0ZaxL1pIBOc02iZ0gDPMr2ig-nhwd_PafstsdIf6HSrjHnP-3p6LCJClYytFT_CBhT9CwNxbRaM5MetS3I-GqwxI3Y8QtgbJbhEQPs0mJ3KExample




21
AWS SysOps Admin
You can upload the files to Amazon S3 either directly or using a snowball device. By using Lifecycle policies to transition the storage class of the object to Glacier, you can ensure that the filename will be preserved.

AWS Personal Health Dashboard provides alerts and remediation guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may impact you. While the Service Health Dashbaord displays the general status of AWS services, Personal Health Dashboard gives you a personalized view into the performance and availability of AWS services underlying your AWS resources.

AWS SysOps Admin
You work as a SysOps Administrator for a company. There is a security requirement to ensure that API calls for EC2 instances be logged. YOu also need to be notified of any Termination API calls for EC2 instances. How can you automate this requirement?

Create a trail in CloudTrail
Create a Lambda function and add it as an event destination for the S3 bucket. Use an SNS topic for notification.




24
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudTrail captures API calls as events. For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, you create a trail. A trail enables CloudTrail to deliver log files of events to an Amazon S3 bucket.
