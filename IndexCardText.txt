Power BI
Fact tables contain observational data while dimension tables contain information about specific entities within the data.



22
Power BI
Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is a programming language that is used throughout Microsoft Power BI for creating calculated columns, measures, and custom tables. It is a collection of functions, operators, and constants that can be used in a formula, or expression, to calculate and return one or more values.



23
Power BI
Calculated columns are materialized in the .pbix Power BI file extension, meaning that each time you add a calculated column, you are increasing the size of the overall file. Having too many calculated columns will slow performance and will cause you to reach the maximum Power BI file size sooner.


24
Power BI
X functions, such as SUMX, COUNTX, MINX, are called iterator functions because, though they are used in measures, they iterate over the individual rows to do their calculations. An X function will perform better and use less disk space than a calculated column.



25
Power BI
Measures are calculated on demand. Power BI calculates the correct value when the user requests it. Measures do not add to the overall disk space of the Power BI .pbix file.





26
Power BI
The CALCULATE function is your method of creating a DAX measure that will override certain portions of the context that are being used to express the correct result.

For instance, if you want to create a measure that always calculates the total sales for 2015, regardless of which year is selected in any other visual in Power BI, you would create a measure that looks like the following sample:

Total Sales for 2015 = CALCULATE(SUM('Sales OrderDetails'[Total Price]), YEAR('Sales OrderDetails'[orderdate]) = 2015)



27
Power BI
To create this measure for Sales by Ship Date, you can use the DAX function USERELATIONSHIP(). This function is used to specify a relationship to be used in a specific calculation and is done without overriding any existing relationships. It is a beneficial feature in that it allows developers to make additional calculations on inactive relationships by overriding the default active relationship between two tables in a DAX expression, as shown in the following example:

Sales by Ship Date = CALCULATE(Sum(Sales[TotalPrice]), USERELATIONSHIP(Sales[ShipDate],'Calendar'[Date]))



28
Power BI
Occasionally, summing a measure doesn't make sense, such as when you are performing inventory counts in a warehouse. For example, if on Monday, you have 100 mountain bikes, and on Tuesday you have 125 mountain bikes, you wouldn't want to add those together to indicate that you had 225 mountain bikes between those two days. In this circumstance, if you want to know your stock levels for March, you would need to tell Power BI not to add the measure but instead take the last value for the month of March and assign it to any visual.





29
Power BI
The YTD Total Sales measure uses a built-in DAX function called TOTALYTD. This function takes an argument for the type of calculation. You can use the SUM function to get the Total Price, as you've done throughout this module. The second argument that you want to operate over is the Dates field. You can use your Dates table and add this measure to your visual, and you'll get the running total result that you're looking for. Y

Power BI
The matrix visual is similar to a table. A table supports two dimensions and the data is flat, meaning duplicate values are displayed and not aggregated. A matrix makes it easier to display data meaningfully across multiple dimensions -- it supports a stepped layout. The matrix automatically aggregates the data and enables you to drill down.

The Robotic Enterprise Framework is meant to be a template that helps the user design processes that offer, at a
barebones minimum, a way to store, read, and easily modify project configuration data, a robust
exception handling scheme and event logging for all exceptions and relevant transaction
information.

While the framework does contain all 3 data flow representations, we chose the state machine
for the main body of the program because it provided a cleaner solution to representing our
desired dataflow.

A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite
automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract
machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can
change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one
state to another is called a transition.



8
UiPath Advanced Developer
Basic rules when using a state machine:
● Since the system can be in only one state at a time, at least one transition condition from
a given state to another must become true either by generating a condition in the code
running inside the state, an external condition, or a combination of both.




9
UiPath Advanced Developer
Basic rules when using a state machine:
● The transition conditions from each state must be exclusive (two transitions cannot be
true at the same time, thus allowing two possible paths of exit from a state).



10
UiPath Advanced Developer
Basic rules when using a state machine:
● Another rule that is agreed upon is that no heavy processing must be done in the
Transition actions. All processing should be done inside the state.

In the Robotic Enterprise Framework, the global variables are those variables whose scope is the main program, or main workflow.
They can be found in the main.xaml workflow file, by first clicking anywhere inside the main
state machine and then clicking the variables pane. Table 2 is a list of the project’s global
variables.

UiPath Advanced Developer
The following are the global variables in the Robotic Enterprise Framework with datatype
TransactionItem QueueItem
TransactionData
SystemError Exception
BusinessRuleException BusinessRuleException
TransactionNumber Int32
Config Dictionary(x:String, x:Object)
RetryNumber Int32
TransactionID string
TransactionField1 string
TransactionField2 string

In the Robotic Enterprise Framework:
InitAllSettings.xaml workflow

This workflow outputs a settings Dictionary with key/value pairs to be used in the project.
Settings are read from local config file then fetched from Orchestrator assets. Assets will
overwrite the config file settings

Robotic Enterprise Framework:

Init Transitions
At the end of the Init State we should have read our configuration file into the dictionary Config,
a global variable, cleaned the working environment by calling the KillAllApplications.xaml
workflow only during startup, and initialised all the applications we will work with.

Get Transaction Data State
GetTransactionData.xaml workflow
Description: Get data from spreadsheets, databases, email, web API or UiPath server queues. If
no new data, set out_TransactionItem to Nothing.

REFramework
Process Transaction State

Process.xaml workflow
In this file all other process specific files will be invoked. If an application exception occurs, the
current transaction can be retried. If a BRE is thrown, the transaction will be skipped. Can be a
flowchart or sequence. If the process is simple, the developer should split the process into
subprocesses and call them, one at a time, in the Process.xaml workflow.

Robotic Enterprise framework
SetTransactionStatus.xaml workflow

This workflow sets the TransactionStatus and Logs that status and details in extra Logging
Fields.
The flowchart branches out into the three possible Transaction Statuses: Success, Business
Exception and Application Exception.

REFramework:
TakeScreenshot.xaml workflow

Usage: Set in_Folder to the folder Name where you want to save the screenshot. Alternatively,
supply the full path including file name in io_FilePath. Description: This workflow captures a
screenshot and logs it's name and location. It then saves it. If io_FilePath is empty, it will try to
save the picture in in_Folder. It uses .png extension.

Robotic Enterprise Framework:

Process Transaction Transitions

If we have an Application Exception we
close all programs, kill them if they fail to
close, take a screenshot at the moment
the exception happened, and go to Init,
where we will reinitialize our working
environment and begin anew from the
transaction that failed (retrying until we
have reached the maximum retry limit)

REFramework:
GetAppCredentials.xaml workflow

Usage: Change in_Credential to a previously created Orchestrator asset or a Windows
credential and use outputs out_Username and out_Password.

Description: This workflow securely fetches or creates and uses a set of credentials defined at
it's input. It first tries to fetch them from Orchestrator. Failing that, it tries to fetch them from the
Windows credential manager. If they do not exist, it creates them and then outputs them.

Breaking down a log message

in_Config("LogMessage_ApplicationException").ToString+" Retry: "+io_RetryNumber.ToString+".
"+in_SystemError.Message+" at Source: "+in_SystemError.Source

The first part of the message, in_Config("LogMessage_ApplicationException").ToString , is read from
the Config dictionary, which enables easy modification if it is required. It is located in the
Constants sheet of the Config excel file, and its content at the moment of writing this is “System
exception.”
Next we append the constant string “ Retry: “ to which we append the value of the
io_RetryNumber, that is the retry we have reached.
Next we append the in_SystemError message and source,
