Workflow Diff is used for comparing changes made in the project.json file, such as adding, updating or removing dependencies, modifying the runtime rule, making workflows private, or setting a Global Exception Handler.

📘
Note:

Workflow Diff must be used after the file is saved, and before it's checked into the source control repository.

Aside from Workflow Diff, Show History from the same context menu allows you to compare changes between two versions of the same file. This option is available for GIT, TFS, and SVN versioned files, either .xaml or project.json.

Automation on a virtual environment is done through visual recognition of elements rather than direct UI object interaction. This means that the RDP window needs to be visible at all times for most UI actions to work.

To redirect the Robot through a proxy server, you have to make multiple configurations on the Robot machine. They are split into the following steps:

Configure your preferred web browser, to ensure that the Robot machine can access Orchestrator through the indicated proxy server.
Edit the Robot and NuGet configuration files, to ensure that the connection between the Robot and Orchestrator is routed through the provided proxy server and that the activities packages and the automation processes can be downloaded through the specified proxy server.

The Service Mode Robot/Robot Service is launched by the Windows Service Control Manager under the Local System. It can open interactive Windows sessions, and has all the rights of a machine administrator. As such, it enables automatic session management (such as log on and log off) for unattended jobs. It is recommended to use the Service Mode Robot for large-scale platform deployments.

UiPath Assistant and Studio (clients) require communication with Robot Service. This is a separate Windows process, which is automatically started by the client if it is not already running, with the same elevation level as the client.

2021.4.5 bug fix
A fix has been introduced that corrected a race condition when different priority jobs were run against a single robot. This caused the jobs to fail with the following error message: "A foreground process is already running. Only one foreground process can run at a time".

The User Mode Robot Service (UiPath.Service.UserHost.exe):
Windows application automatically launched if the SCM-managed Robot Service is not installed;
Best suited for attended automation scenarios;
Has the rights of the user that installed it;
Is not listed under Windows services;
Requires a user to be logged in to execute jobs from Orchestrator;
Deployed by default through UiPathStudioSetup.exe.

When the Robot receives the Cancel command, it cancels the execution of the current activity and starts executing the final steps. If this takes more than 3 seconds, the process is killed.

On the other hand, when the Robot receives the command to Kill a process, it first tries to Cancel the execution and if the execution is not finished in 3 seconds, the process is killed.

BlockUser activity -
Once the designated hotkey combination for reactivating user input is pressed, and user input is restored, it cannot be blocked again during the same runtime. The hotkey combination is implemented as a safeguard against blocking yourself from stopping the workflow while developing it.

With SimulateType set as the input method for each of these activities, the automation can run without capturing the user's keyboard and mouse and they won’t need to worry that they might interfere with the log in process.

It's worth noting that Microsoft Office applications in general do not run successfully in Picture-in-Picture mode if they are already open in the user's main session.  

For automations which use both the PiP mode and Office products, either ensure they are closed in the user's session, or change the Target Session of the workflow that uses the apps to Main.

UiPath Advanced Developer

Only one Picture-in-Picture session can be started at a time on the same machine.

Run as administrator cannot be used in PiP sessions.

The machine cannot be restarted or shut down while the PiP session is opened as the PiP session needs to be closed beforehand.

The Background Process is a template for creating processes that can run in parallel on the same Robot, together with one foreground process. For this reason, background processes must not contain activities that require UI Interaction activities like Click and Type Into.

A fired trigger passes arguments to the group of activities that run. These arguments contain information about the event, including the name of the trigger, the trigger type, and an event info object that enables us to extract different types of data about the trigger and its target.

 If we start a background process with a foreground scope and another entity is running in the foreground (either a process or another foreground scope), the background process goes into a queue and waits, determined by the ‘Wait for foreground’ property, to acquire foreground.
