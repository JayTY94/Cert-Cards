Creating a list of strings in the variables panel does not instantiate it. Instantiate with an empty list by adding

new List(of String)

in the Default column

When using the Invoke Method activity, it’s important to know what kind of method we are calling, instance or static. We can quickly find this out from the method signature.

Static methods contain the word “static” in the signature. Instance methods do not.

We can declare DateTime variables using the System.DateTime type and assign the current date by using the Now method.

DateTime.Parse
–
Converts variables from string to DateTime variables. This method only works with Invariant culture time formatting variations.
For the invariant culture, this pattern is "MM/dd/yyyy".

Removing Keys
–
VarName.Remove(Key) – removes an item from the Dictionary. It can be used in an ‘Assign’ activity.



16
UiPath Developer
VarName is a Dictionary object.
VarName.Item(Key) – returns the Dictionary item by its key
VarName.Count – returns an Int32 value of the number of Dictionary items
VarName.ContainsKey(Key) – checks if the item with the given key exists in the Dictionary and returns a Boolean result

Regular Expressions provide a powerful method for processing text by matching patterns.

The RegEx Builder wizard helps us build and test Regular Expression search criteria.




18
UiPath Developer
The output of the Matches activity (whjch uses a RegEx) is of type IEnumerable of System.Text.RegularExpressions.Match. This is the type we need to set in a For Each activity if we want to iterate through a collection of matches.

Full selectors:
Contain all the elements needed to identify a UI element, including the top-level window
Generated by the Basic recorder
Recommended when switching between multiple windows



20
UiPath Developer
Partial selectors:
Generated by the Desktop recorder
Do not contain information about the top-level window
Activities containing partial selectors are enclosed in a container (Attach Browser or Attach Window) that contains a full selector of the top-level window
Recommended when performing multiple actions in the same window



21
UiPath Developer
FullText is the default screen scraping method, it is fast and accurate, yet unlike the Native screen scraping method, it cannot extract the screen coordinates of the text.





22
UiPath Developer
Both the FullText and Native screen scraping methods work only with desktop applications, but the Native method only works with apps that are built to render text with the Graphics Device Interface (GDI).

Selectors with Wildcards

Wildcards are symbols that enable you to replace zero or multiple characters in a string. These can be quite useful when dealing with dynamically-changing attributes in a selector.

Asterisk (*) – replaces zero or more characters
Question mark (?) – replaces a single character



24
UiPath Developer
Selectors are Properties of UI Automation activities which help the robot identify UI Elements. They contain the attributes of each graphical user interface element and its parents as XML fragments.



25
UiPath Developer
Some examples of when selectors require fine-tuning are when the target elements contain dynamic IDs, when the selectors are too specific or when they contain IDXs.





26
UiPath Developer
UI Explorer lets us create a custom selector for a specific UI element. The Visual Tree panel displays a tree of the UI hierarchy and enables us to navigate through it, by clicking the arrows in front of each node.


27
UiPath Developer
The top part of the Selector Editor panel enables us to view all the nodes in a selector and eliminate the ones that are not necessary by clearing the check box in front of them.
The bottom part of the panel displays the actual XML fragment that we have to use in a project.


28
UiPath Developer
When it comes to Classic recorders, the Basic Recorder generates full selectors while the Desktop recorder generates partial selectors. 



29
UiPath Developer
Full selectors contain all the information required to identify a specific UI element. It’s recommended to use full selectors when the robot must switch between multiple windows while performing the automation workflow.  



30
UiPath Developer
Fine-tuning is the process of refining selectors in order to have the workflow correctly executed in situations in which the generated selector is unreliable, too specific or too sensitive with regards to system changes.

When using a variable to fine tune a selector, the variable name must be inside quotation marks and double curly braces.
attribute="{{VariableName}}"



2
UiPath Developer
To identify a target, a UI Automation activity can either use a selector of type string in the Selector property or an object of type UI Element in the Element property, but not both.

To set default values in UiPath Studio:
Project Panel > Gear/Settings > UI Automation Modern
I use modern, not classic for the most part.

UiPath Developer
It is good practice to create one folder in the project folder for each app used in the automation.
