BlockUser activity -
Once the designated hotkey combination for reactivating user input is pressed, and user input is restored, it cannot be blocked again during the same runtime. The hotkey combination is implemented as a safeguard against blocking yourself from stopping the workflow while developing it.

With SimulateType set as the input method for each of these activities, the automation can run without capturing the user's keyboard and mouse and they won’t need to worry that they might interfere with the log in process.

It's worth noting that Microsoft Office applications in general do not run successfully in Picture-in-Picture mode if they are already open in the user's main session.  

For automations which use both the PiP mode and Office products, either ensure they are closed in the user's session, or change the Target Session of the workflow that uses the apps to Main.

Only one Picture-in-Picture session can be started at a time on the same machine.

Run as administrator cannot be used in PiP sessions.

The machine cannot be restarted or shut down while the PiP session is opened as the PiP session needs to be closed beforehand.

The Background Process is a template for creating processes that can run in parallel on the same Robot, together with one foreground process. For this reason, background processes must not contain activities that require UI Interaction activities like Click and Type Into.

A fired trigger passes arguments to the group of activities that run. These arguments contain information about the event, including the name of the trigger, the trigger type, and an event info object that enables us to extract different types of data about the trigger and its target.

 If we start a background process with a foreground scope and another entity is running in the foreground (either a process or another foreground scope), the background process goes into a queue and waits, determined by the ‘Wait for foreground’ property, to acquire foreground.
