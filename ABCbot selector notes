"<wnd app='winword.exe' cls='OpusApp' title='*EditCopy.doc*Word' /><wnd app='winword.exe' title='Paragraph' aastate='moveable, focusable' /><ctrl name='Mirror indents' role='check box' />"


<wnd app='winword.exe' cls='bosa_sdm_msword' title='Paragraph' />
<ctrl name='Mirror indents' role='check box' />


Why is this full selector broken?
"<wnd app='winword.exe' cls='OpusApp' title='*EditCopy.doc*Word' /><wnd app='winword.exe' cls='*_msword' title='Paragraph' /><ctrl name='Mirror indents' role='check box' />"
<wnd app='winword.exe' cls='OpusApp' title='*EditCopy.doc*Word' />
<wnd app='winword.exe' cls='*_msword' title='Paragraph' />
<ctrl name='Mirror indents' role='check box' />


Partial selector. I've tested the full selector and it's broken.
"<wnd app='winword.exe' cls='*_msword' title='Paragraph' /><ctrl name='Mirror indents' role='check box' />"

and the partial selector works when I try it in the Ui Explorer! What the heck!
Trying the full selector again?


Here's what I get when I indicate the element.
<wnd app='winword.exe' cls='bosa_sdm_msword' title='Paragraph' />
<ctrl name='Mirror indents' role='check box' />




Here's the thing that I want to see if it works. Does the full selector work with this known to work partial selector tied to teh scope selector?
<wnd app='winword.exe' cls='OpusApp' title='*EditCopy.doc*Word' />
<wnd app='winword.exe' cls='bosa_sdm_msword' title='Paragraph' />
<ctrl name='Mirror indents' role='check box' />


ok when we combine the first line with the partial selector, it stops working... so am I selecting two items at the same node level?

I have tried to change the top level selector for the whole card. Let's see what the full selector looks like now.
"<wnd app='winword.exe' cls='OpusApp' title='*EditCopy.doc*Word' /><wnd app='winword.exe' cls='*_msword' title='Paragraph' /><ctrl name='Mirror indents' role='check box' />"

here's that full selector so that I can copy it into ui explorer.
<wnd app='winword.exe' cls='OpusApp' title='*EditCopy.doc*Word' />
<wnd app='winword.exe' cls='*_msword' title='Paragraph' />
<ctrl name='Mirror indents' role='check box' />

And ^^^ does not work. at least that's consistant. Let's look at the click selector for the right click. That one I know works, so maybe it'll help.
"<uia cls='_WwG' name='*EditCopy.doc*' />"


it's a different uia cls. fioadjfoiawefohfasdohfdalskhjfclkjh;jga. Is the paragraph dialog box to be thought of as an entirely new application. I thought that it was tied into the MS Word window somehow.

I tried getting rid of the window selector for the click activity. Ran again.
"<wnd app='winword.exe' cls='OpusApp' title='*EditCopy.doc*Word' /><wnd app='winword.exe' cls='*_msword' title='Paragraph' /><ctrl name='Mirror indents' role='check box' />"

It looks like it got put right back because the field was empty when I hit ok.

MAYBE I should use

<wnd app='winword.exe' cls='*_msword' title='Paragraph' />

instead of the default window selector...

then this would go in the selector box.
<ctrl name='Mirror indents' role='check box' />


IT WORKED YEAHHHHHHH
