The following cards


These cards got reassigned to the Verkada user Lost Cards last weekend when Eric and Jay were cleaning up the users and making sure that users had only one card assigned.

I'm looking into which account exactly they belonged to. Going to take more time.

Tips to make better workflows using UiPath

RPA is taking hte world by storm. It allows the companies to automate mundane taks so that their resources could focus on something more important. This is beneficial not only for the company but also allows the employee to get their hands dirty in other areas of the industry as well.

Tools such as uiPath not only...

Here are some of the tips that could help you make yoru workflows more efficient -

#1 Using Global variables.

If you have any experience in programming, then you know the importance of global variables. While creating workflows we usually pass all the required variables as arguments to different workflows. The flaw with this approach is that if there is a small change in arguments of any one of the workflow, then all other workflows where it was called have to be modified.

In order to introduce global variable functionality in our workflow, we can use the Getter Setter activity.

It's looking like that's not in modern... Which is NOT a good sign!!!!


https://docs.uipath.com/studio/docs/test-activities

Test Activities

The Test Activity context menu option of the Designer panel is used for running a test of the currently selected activity. When clicked, the Locals panel opens displaying the variables and arguments in scope.

Test Activity can be used in two ways:

    Add default values to properties and test

    Add arguments and/or properties to activity properties and use the Local panel to add values after clickign the Test Activity option.

Double-click on the value field of a variable or argument or click the edit icon in the Locals pane, and add a new value. Next, click Step Into to focus and execute the activity, and monitor the variable or argument's value in the Locals panel.

The same is available when clickign Continue, but the variables are not visible in the Locals Panel.

Please take into consideration that dynamic checks when variabels depend on other variables that are defined later are not supported.

Execution logs generated by the Test Activity action are visible in the Output panel. Exceptions in Studio can be bubbled up, which means that the exception may be passed to parent containers in case it may be handled by them.

The Test Activity option is not available during debugging.

Example of Using Test Activity

For the If Activity, we created a process that asks the user for two numbers, checks to see if one is divisible by the otgher, and depending on the result, displays a different message in the Output panel.

To check the behavior of the If activity defined in the process, use the Test Activity option, as illustrated below:

The Test Activity action places the activity in the debugger and asks you for values to variables. Once provided, click the Continue button for the debugging process to continue. In this particular case, a message was written in the Output panel with the correct answer, which means that the expressions written in the If activity were correct.

Create Test Bench

The Create Test Bench option allows for the creation of automation building blocks, which can then be tested and added to the final workflow.

It is sued for testing activities, working with variables, and debugging the process. All this is done in a test bench workflow, a temporary sequence that's not part of the current proejct and that is discarded when closed.

The Create Test Bench option is similar to the Test Activity option, with the exception that the latter is contained and defined in an actual workflow.

To use the Create Test Bench option, go to the Activities panel search bar or use [the] Ctrl + Alt + F keyboard shortcut. Type the name of hte activity and right-click to open the context menu.

Select Create Test Bench[,] and the activity is automatically added to a sequence fiel not included in your project. From there yu can add other activities, chagne their default properties, and debug the process. The Output panel displays any logs or error found during debugging.

To save the file to your project, simplu use the ribbon option Save as, add a file name, and save it to the same file path as your project.

Please note that teh Create Test Bench does not work with the Pick Branch activity.

Run to this Activity

The Run to this Activity option is avialable when right-clickign an activity in the Designer panel.

This option starts the debugging process and pauses before teh selected activity is executed while highlighting it in the panel. If Run to this Activity is triggered when debugging is already paused, the execution continues until the activity is reached.

Run from this Activity

The Run from this Activity context menu option enters debugging in a paused state, allowing you to make changes to teh values of variables and arguments from the Locals Panel. Press Continue to start debugging or use actions such as Step Into, Step Over, Step Out.

Note:
An error occurs if you use Run from this Activity for an activity added inside one of the following container activities: Try Catch, Switch, Parallel, Pick, Trigger Scope, or Retry Scope.

What exactly did the step into action do again?
What are automation building blocks, exactly?
What is the Pick Branch Activity?
