Windows 10 in cloud configuration is a Microsoft-recommended device configuration. You can turn any Windows 10 Professional, Enterprise, and Education device into a cloud-optimized device.

It's ideal for:
Frontline workers
Remote workers
Other users with focused workflow needs, like productivity and browsing

Cloud config makes these devices easy to use, and secures these devices with Microsoft-recommended security features.

With Windows 10 in cloud configuration:
You can configure new deivces, or reuse existing hardware.
End users get an easy-to-use and familiar Windows experience.
Administrators get a uniform device configuration across devices, which makes management and troubleshooting easier.
You can customize the names of your resources, so they're easy to see and monitor.

Tip

What this guided scenario does

Using Microsoft Endpoint Manager, you can use a guided scenario to deploy a cloud configuration. The guided scenario automatically creates all the resources you need, including the following resources:

Creates a new Azure AD security group, or uses an existing Azure AD security group.
Deploys the Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Teams apps. For more information on deploying these apps individually, see:
    Add Microsoft Edge for Windows 10
    Add Microsoft 365 apps to Windows devices
Creates a Windows 10 security baseline policy with recommended security settings that are already configured.
For more information about security baselines and what they do, see Use security baselines to configure Windows 10 devices.
Creates a Windows Autopilot enrollment profile that automatically enrolls devices in Microsoft Intune.
For more information on creating your own Autopilot profile, see Configure Autopilot profiles.
Turns on and configures the Autopilot environment status page (ESP). This page shows users the enrollment process.

Improved Conditional Access messaging for Android and iOS/iPad users
Azure Active Directory has updated the wording on a Conditional Access screen to better explain acess and setup requirements to users. Android and iOS/iPadOS users will see this screen when they try to access corporate resources from a device that's not enrolled in Intune management. For more information about this change, see What's new in Azure Active Directory.

Device security
Windows Security experience profiles support tri-state settings
For Windows 10 devices, we've updated the bi-state settings to be tri-state settings in the Windows Security experience profile for Endpoint security and Antivirus policy.

Most settings in the profile previously supported only two options of Yes and Not configured. Moving forward, those same settings now include Yes, Not configured, and a new option of No.

    For existing profiles, settings that are set to Not configured remain as Not configured. When you create new profiles or edit an existing profile, you can now choose to explicitly set No.

In addition, the following applies to configuration of the setting Hide the Virus and threat protection area in the Windows Security app and its child setting Hide the Ransomware data recovery option in the Windows Security app.
